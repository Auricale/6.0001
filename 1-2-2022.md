(from OCW Lecture 1: What is Computation)
# Declarative Knowledge
knowing something
	-ex: You will eat dinner today

# Imperative Knowledge
knowing the steps
	-1. You will walk to the kitchen
	-2. You will scramble some eggs
	-3. You will plate the eggs
	-4. You will eat the eggs 
	
kind of like algorithms in computer science

# Basic Machine Architecture 
you essentially boil "a machine" down to the RAM and CPU
	-the GPU, storage, etc are just extra components are help do our logic

## Processor (or the CPU)
think of the CPU as the brain that's able to do all these advances processes

can be devided into the **control logic** and the **arithmetic logic unit**

### Control Logic
when a program or code is executed the control logic will run into memory

it will grab "step one" or first line of code at the top, and run it
the memory receives the message from the control logic, and sends it to the ALU

### Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
this is where the magic happens, the logic and analysis works here

displays information to screen after working it's magic, then sends a message back to memory
	-if there are more lines of code beyond the first, the process repeats
	-the ALU sends a message back to the control logic, until there aren't any more lines of code to run

# Primitive Contructs
in english: words
in programming: numbers and strings

# Syntax
in english: 
"cow sheep plate" (NOT syntactically valid)
"cow ate sheep" (syntactically valid)

in programming:
"dummy" 5 (NOT syntactically valid)
3 * 4 (syntactically valid)

# Static Semantics
because something is syntically correct, that doesn't necessarily mean it makes sense

in english:
"chicken fly there" (syntactically valid, but static semantic error)
"chicken flew there" (syntically valid, NO static semantic error) 

in programming:
5 ** chickens (syntically valid, but static semantic error)
9 / 3 (syntically valid, NO static semantic error)
